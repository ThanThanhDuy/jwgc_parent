## Overview
### Context
> Nowadays, learning how to raise children scientifically is becoming a trend that mothers come to with the desire to bring their beloved children joy and happiness every day.
### Problem
> Especially for young mothers, who will face hundreds of hardships when their first child is born with too little experience. Why does the baby cry? Is your baby hungry, in pain, or scared? What is the best food for babies? A large number of questions can not be answered easily.
### Solutions
> JWGC will provide an application to help parents refer to various helpful content such as a child’s weekly developmental milestones, update blogs and questions daily based on their baby's age; save, and share blogs and questions that interest them. Besides that, JWGC will remind parents of the vaccination schedule of children based on age following regulations of the Ministry of Health
